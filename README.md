<h1> Small Game Library using GUI</h1>

 ### 
<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a console-based Java implementation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. It contains two game modes: 

1. **TicTacToe against CPU**: This option challenges the player against a computer-controlled opponent. The player and CPU alternate placing their respective symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid, attempting to complete a row, column, or diagonal of their symbols before the opponent.


2. **TicTacToe vs. Friend**: In this mode, two players compete against each other on the same computer. Each player alternates placing their symbol on the grid, hoping to create a winning pattern before their opponent.

The project is organized in three Java classes:

1. Main: This class includes the main method and serves as the program's entry point. It prompts the user to select one of the two game modes and then initializes the appropriate game object based on the user's choice.
  
2. TicTacFriend: This class handles the logic for the TicTacToe vs. Friend game mode. It accepts user input, updates the game board, determines a winner, and displays the game board.
   
3. TicTacToeCpu: This class handles the logic for the TicTacToe vs. CPU game mode. Similar to TicTacFriend, it accepts user input, updates the game board, determines the winner, and shows the game board. It also incorporates logic that allows the CPU player to make random moves.
